The [**Z Shell**](https://www.zsh.org/) (or **zsh**) is a Unix shell, i.e. a command-line interpreter (CLI) that provides an user interface for Unix-like operating systems (including [Git Bash](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/git-bash) on Windows systems). Zsh is an extended [**Bourne shell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell) with many improvements[^1] (command-line completion, file globbing, spelling correction and autofill of command names, themeable prompts, etc.).
It's the default shell on MacOS computers since 2019. Other operating systems use [**Bash**](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) as the default shell.

In this post, we will see how to install and configure zsh and [**Oh My ZSH!**](https://ohmyz.sh/), an open source, community-driven framework for managing the Zsh configuration.
